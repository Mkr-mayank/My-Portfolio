    <p>Hi! I am Mayank Kumar. I belong to Gaya, Bihar.Currently I am pursuing Bachelor of Technology in College of Engineering and Management, Kolaghat. My department is Computer Science and Engineering. Besides that I am learning Data Structure and Algorithms in Java, the concept of OOPs and App Development which will be also beneficial to build purpose driven projects.</p> 
    <p>I joined National Cadet Corps in the year 2021. From there I learnt about unity, discipline, teamwork, leadership and motivation which improved my personality to a large extent. My hobbies are cycling, playing badminton and origami. In future I want to choose my career as a Software Developer which could be helpful in different aspects such as defence, education, and agriculture.</p>
